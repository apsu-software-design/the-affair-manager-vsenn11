# The Affair Manager

This repo contains code for a command-line application to manage events (called "affairs" in the code), created as part of an assignment for CSCI 4602 at Austin Peay State University.

The below questions should be answered _in detail_ regarding your submission!

##### Reflect on how you determined the architecture of your application. What process did you use to determine which classes to define? #####
> I read through the code within the UI.js file and wrote down all the em.insertFunctionHere calls. I then created the three classes(Organization, Member, Affair) and color coded the functions I had written down. The classes were made based off of what had "add" functions. As far as why I put certain functions within certain classes I tried to keep all things relating to one another i.e. any modifications to objects went inside the class of the same name. 

##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc)? If so, please list who (be specific!). #####
> w3schools.com was my best friend in this assignment. I looked up syntax and search methods for js arrays/objects. 

##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this assignment? #####
> I would say around 3-4. It took me a little while to actually understand what I was supposed to do, but once I got the ball rolling it went pretty quickly. The tips within the assignment doc were very helpful. 


##### On a scale of 1 (too easy) to 10 (too challenging), how difficult was this assignment? #####
>I would say a 7? I know I didn't implement the modifyAffair method correctly. I'm not sure how I was supposed to know what exactly the user was trying to edit. 


##### Did you encounter any problems in this assignment we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the assignment better? #####
> Other than the modifyAffair function mentioned before I don't think so. Maybe some clear instructions on how we can test the entire program?
